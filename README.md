# What is a UI Designer? 

> ## Design is the silent ambassador of your brand.
> –  Paul Rand, Art Director.

# While everyone can point out examples of bad design, good design often goes unnoticed by users since it provides them a seamless experience. Good design is felt throughout the lifecycle of the product or service. 

User Interface (UI) design comes into play late in the design process, just before the product or service is handed off to developers. In UI design, all of the deliverables are exclusively **visual** and the majority of the work is the **digital** space.

UI designers are responsible for shaping the fine **look and feel** of a product, app or website while also considering its usability. They must design for a variety of functionalities, users and contexts using branding, color, photography and typography. Good user interface design facilitates the user in accomplishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself all the meanwhile being an extension of the existing brand aesthetic. UI Designers aim to create designs users will find easy to use as well as visually and emotionally pleasurable.

**Interaction Design (IxD)** could be a part of a UI Designer’s day-to-day responsibilities  -- but this is not always a requirement. This role focuses on how the visual design interacts with its users. For digital products or services, this includes motion design, such as animations and transitions. When talking about physical (non-digital) products, Interaction Design is about exploring how a user might interact physically with that particular product.

With all the types of design and the overlapping skills necessary for each type, it’s easy to get them mixed up. When we talk about a UI designer, we’re talking about a visual designer that understands user experience and knows a little about most things design – specifically, graphic design, branding design and web design. Although it happens often enough, a UI designer is not be confused with a graphic designer, branding designer or web designer. Rather, they possess a some of the basic skills that make each other of those designer types successful.
 
So, what’s the difference between a UI designer and the other designers they share skillsets with? By each type:
A graphic designer is generally tied exclusively to print design, rather than digital design like UI designers
A branding designer is a logo specialist who designs the visual components of a user’s experience of a company (logo placement, colors, etc.) – either in print or online
A web designer is focused only on designing digital websites whereas UI designers focus on all types of digital interfaces (smart watches, home appliances, kiosks, car interfaces, etc.)
 
A successful UI designer will understand print design, brand extension and website creation – but none of those things are their sole focus. Instead, those design aspects and skills are utilized altogether in their day-to-day tasks to help them create better user interfaces that solve real-world problems 

# Part brand ambassador, part visual designer, part motion designer, UI Designers:
